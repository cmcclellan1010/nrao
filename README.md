## To Do
 - [X] Write code to generate a DS9 region file from a fits file, using dendrograms
 - [ ] Iterate through different min_value, min_delta, min_npix settings to find best/cleanest source extraction parameters
 - [ ] Use 2x smoothed images to reject bad sources using annulus RMS / peak flux comparison on PSFs
 - [ ] Create flux histograms for all cataloged sources
